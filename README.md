# Analysing Airbnb 2019 Dataset

Welcome to the Exploratory Analysis of the Airbnb Dataset! In this project, we aim to understand Airbnb rental landscape in New York City through exploratory analysis on the Airbnb dataset. Through static and interactive visualizations, we will try to find the influence of various factors on price of the houses.

##### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Conclusion

* Most listings are for private and entire apartment, which concludes that most people dont like live in shared room/apartment. People who prefer share rooms must be tourists.

* As expected mean price of entire apartment is greater than Private room and cheapest is Shared room.

* Another observation can be made that the Mean Prices for 'Private' and 'Shared' Room Type of all Neighbourhood Groups are almost same.

* People tend to prefer less valued stays as per given Airbnb data.

* We have found that hosts take good advantage of the Airbnb platform and provide the most listings.
